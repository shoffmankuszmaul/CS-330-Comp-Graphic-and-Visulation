3D scene using Visual Studio 2019

How do I approach designing software?
Designing software is, in my opinion, best approached as a puzzle. When given a set of requirements or features.   I would provide options for the customer, then depending on what solution is chosen, I would start creating the base of the software and then move on to specific functionality.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Having already failed this class once, I enlisted a tutor to help explain things and providing feedback. I focused primarily on creating the objects in the scene.  One of my original objects was a teapot but I ended up discarding it in favor of a lamp which turned out to be something I could actually accomplish.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
Much of the process I used was simply testing and retesting. I did this by making small adjustments and then running the code until I created each individual object in the position, I wanted it to be. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think whether one is working on something visual, like graphic design or rendering, or simply coding in general, testing and making small adjustments is very important.  Also lots of comments in the code make it a lot easier to debug and to fix problems or make small adjustments to the final picture.  
How do I approach developing programs?
I like to start small with the most basic coding then add more functionality or features one piece at a time.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Just creating the basic objects was a major part of my strategy.  Other things like texture and lighting could follow but as long as the basic components were there, I could take my time coding the rest. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration helps to ensure the code is readable and easier to work with. Having the code broken down into smaller parts and well commented allows one to work with specific portions of the code more efficiently.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My original milestones were a bit simpler and were focused more on each individual object, rather than the entire scene. I felt this was a good decision, as it help me focus on one thing at a time. The also kept me from being overwhelmed. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Currently I am a Software Analyst.  My goals are to finish my degree so that I have more opportunities within my company.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I struggled with this class, and I really hope that none of my other classes will have me doing anything with graphics.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
To be honest my company doesn’t use the Visual Studio product at all.  I honestly hope never to have to work with graphics again.
